## FileType Manager \(modFileType\.bas\)


</div>

### Description

This module enables you to manage file types programmatically (by accessing the Windows Registry). For example change Text Documents (.txt) to open with a text editor other than Notepad; Change the icon of eg. Text Documents. And a whole lot more.

I hope you find this useful!
 
### More Info
 
All functions have their own input parameters which is described within the code.

You need to know what a file type is, what it's used, etc. You can figure out most of it by going to View, Options, clicking the File Types tab in Windows Explorer (Win95) and playing around there. Again, be careful not to mess up something.

There is also a module included for accessing the Registry. The module was written by Randy Mcdowell. I DID NOT write it.

Some functions do return something, though the majority doesn't. Also described within the code.

You must be careful when you use this code. If you remove a certain file type for example, you could have a problem if you don't know how to repair it. Just be careful.
